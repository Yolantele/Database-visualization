### Challenges:
- Working with unfamiliar code - As we tried to gain exposure to different technologies
- Completing unit, service/API and feature tests within a new language using different frameworks, assertion libraries and testrunners - took longer to set up than anticipated
- To include table associations

### Learning:
- Benefits of mobbing - especially when using new technologies
- Think a feature through before starting the development process - we ended up with a feature that worked in the back-end but couldnâ€™t translate it to front-end


### Instructions for use: 
This app connects to a database called 'data_vis_development', using postgres as database. Please see config/db.js and c change it should you need to. Two seed files are provided with this project which you can use to see the app working.

1. Clone the app and seed the database:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Yolantele/Database-visualization.git
$ cd Database-visualization
$ node seedMovies.js
$ node seedSongs.js
```

2. run the app:

```

```

3. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.


4. run tests:

```
$ npm test
```
