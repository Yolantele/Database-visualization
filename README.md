### Challenges:
- Working with unfamiliar code - As we tried to gain exposure to different technologies
- Completing unit, service/API and feature tests within a new language using different frameworks, assertion libraries and testrunners - took longer to set up than anticipated
- To include table associations

### Learning:
- Benefits of mobbing - especially when using new technologies
- Think a feature through before starting the development process - we ended up with a feature that worked in the back-end but couldnâ€™t translate it to front-end

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions -->


As a User:

```
So that I can understand created databases better
I want to see a visual representation of data in graphs
```
```
So that I can comprehend data better
I want to see data represented in different graph types: for example table, bar-chart
```
```
So that I can use many different databases
I want to plug in any database I choose : movies, songs ect.
